# Yet Another Urdu Keyboard
A jQuery plugin for typing in Urdu using an English keyboard. 

There are too many controls out there which convert English to Urdu.<br/>
Some of them are phonetic, some not.<br/>
Some are open-source, some not.<br/>
Some have keys that you can press, some don't.<br/>
Some work on mobile phones, some don't.<br/>

This is a phonetic open-source mobile enabled jQuery plugin which enables typing in Urdu using an English keyboard.<br/>

```javascript
// This line sets enables Urdu input for the input box with id q.
$('#q').setUrduInput();
```
